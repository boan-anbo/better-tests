## Think through your software with Test Acts

### 1. What before How

Did you ever feel that you only started to know what your software __reall__ is, after you have written the code?

Sometimes, this is inevitable as part of the process of development, but sometimes

```ts
const act: ActData
```

### 2. Specification before Implementation

### 3. User before Developer

- A User story

| Is                                    | Is Not                                |
|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| From a user's perspective             | From a developer's perspective        |
| Tells a narrative, i.e. a story       | Tells about implementation detail     |
| __Concrete__ like stories in contexts | __Concrete__ like an technical issues |
|
### 4. Scenario before Testing1

## Use Test Acts with TDD/BDD workflows

## Perspective of the users

### Helpers

```ts
import {A} from 'test-acts'
```

- :heavy_check_mark: **Plan** your tests in a tree structure.
